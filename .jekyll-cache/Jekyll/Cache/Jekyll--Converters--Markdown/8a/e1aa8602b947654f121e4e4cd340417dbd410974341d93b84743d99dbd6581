<p>As my first building exercise at Lambda School, I teamed up with a classmate of mine to tackle our first build week project at Lambda School. Our job was to simply create a mortgage calculator. Instead, we decided to make an app full of features that could facilitate many different aspects of the home buying experience. We divided the app into four tabs, each of us building out two of those tabs. My partner took on the mortgage caclulator and home buying tips, while I built a home affortability calculator and cost of living calculator. Together, we created <em>Simple Home Calculator</em>.</p>
