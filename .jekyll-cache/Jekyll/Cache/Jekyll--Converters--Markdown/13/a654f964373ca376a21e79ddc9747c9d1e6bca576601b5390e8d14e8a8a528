I"<h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>

<p>I describe myself as a hard worker who is eager to learn. I spend most of my free time learning and teaching myself new skills. I was awarded Florida State University’s Student Employee of the Year Award for my hard work and ability to innovate. I have also written and published my own iOS app to solve a major problem that students at my school and iPhone users in general have when they lose their phones. In doing so, I discovered my passion for developing applications for iOS and other Apple platforms and enrolled in Lambda School to further my education into iOS Development.</p>
