<p>Eco-Soap Bank is a humanitarian and environmental non-profit organization working to save, sanitize, and supply recycled hotel soap for the developing world. Lack of access to soap remains a critical factor in fighting the spread of preventable diseases worldwide. In some areas of the developing world, only 1% of households have soap for handwashing. Eco-Soap Bank seeks to address the critical need for hygiene. Working since 2014, Eco-Soap Bank has sustainably supplied over 650,000 people with soap and hygiene education.</p>

<h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>

<p>I wanted to make a product that iOS developers could use everyday. Something that would have an impact on how they wrote code while making an everyday task easier for them. I chose to create an app that allows designers and developers to easily convert Hex and RGB values to UIColor, something that I found myself doing a lot.</p>

<p>Color Convert is written 100% programmatically. It also incorporates view animations and Handoff between devices using UIPasteboard. On release, Color Convert reached the top charts at <strong>#53 for Developer Tools in the App Store.</strong></p>
