<h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>

<p>I wanted to make a product that iOS developers could use everyday. Something that would have an impact on how they wrote code while making an everyday task easier for them. I chose to create an app that allows them to easily convert Hex to UIColor, something that I found myself doing a lot.</p>

<p>Color Convert is written <strong>100% programmatically</strong> without use of storyboards. It also incorporates <strong>view animations</strong> and <strong>Handoff</strong> between devices using UIPasteboard. On release, Color Convert reached the top charts at <strong>#53 for Developer Tools in the App Store.</strong></p>
