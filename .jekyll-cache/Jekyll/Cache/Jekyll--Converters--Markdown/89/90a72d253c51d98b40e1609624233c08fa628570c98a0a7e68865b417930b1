I"ã<p>iStats is a web-app that allows users to see statistics based on their sent iMessages. iStats was written in Python and makes use of the <em>chat.db</em> file generated by macOS and iOS devices. The front-end was created using Flask, HTML, and JavaScript to output statistics in a readable format.</p>

<h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>

<p>iStats was motivated by Appleâ€™s lack of a proper search functionality (prior to iOS 13) for messages in iMessage. As our semester long group project in CIS 4930: Python Programming, we built iStats to both create a search functionality, while also outputting other interesting user data such as: most used words, emojis, most texted contact number, and more.</p>
