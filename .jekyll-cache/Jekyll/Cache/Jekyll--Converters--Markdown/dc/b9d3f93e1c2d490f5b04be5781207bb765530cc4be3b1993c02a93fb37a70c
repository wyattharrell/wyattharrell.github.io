I"H<p>Linkbook is a powerful web-app that can store your favorite links, keep you organized, and much more. Linkbook does all the work for the user by parsing websites to give them a snapshot of each page they save by grabbing the websiteâ€™s top image, title, and summary beased on the link provided. It also recommends related articles based on keywords found in each website they save. Users can organize their links based on category and even share saved links to their friends.</p>

<p>Linkbook was created as a better bookmarking tool in order to all users to keep up with links based on their corresponding category. It was written as part of my semester long project in Software Engineering (CEN 4020) at Florida State University.</p>
