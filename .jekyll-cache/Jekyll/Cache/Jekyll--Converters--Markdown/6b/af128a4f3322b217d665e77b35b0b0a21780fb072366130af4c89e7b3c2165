  <p>While other companies design beutiful hardware, excel at marketing, hire good lawyers, and manufacture gadgets at scale, no other company makes software as intuitive, carefully crafted, or just plain fun. If there is unique magic in Apple’s products, it’s in the software. –<em>Creative Selection</em> by Ken Kocienda</p>
