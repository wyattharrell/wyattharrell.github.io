I"ù<h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>

<p>As someone who enjoys the creative nature of building new things, computer science has always been a natural fit for me. I began my journey into computer science at Florida State University. While I was there, I was awarded Florida State University‚Äôs Student Employee of the Year Award for my hard work and ability to innovate. I also wrote and published my own iOS app to solve a major problem that students at my school and iPhone users in general have when they lose their phones. In doing so, I discovered my passion for developing iOS applications and enrolled in Lambda School to further my education into iOS development. I am a hard worker who is eager to learn and spend most of my free time teaching myself new skills.</p>
