<a href="https://therowing.app">The Rowing App</a> is the go-to rowing app for rowers and coaches created by former US Junior National Team coxswain, Wyatt Harrell. 

The Rowing App features six coaching tools including a stroke rate timer, pace calculator, VO2max calculator, and many more. It also provides coaches with the ability to manage their boats and roster while building daily lineups and recording workouts.
