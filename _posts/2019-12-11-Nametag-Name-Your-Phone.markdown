Nametag is the only app that makes it easy to reclaim your lost phone. Think “luggage tag,” but for your phone. Nametag lets you display your name, email address, and an emergency contact number on your lock screen to help whoever finds your phone get in touch with you. 

### Motivation

I had the idea for Nametag during my second year at Florida State. I noticed a large number of posts on Facebook from people posting photos of phones they had found during the previous night. Each post relied on people who recognized the lock screen background or recent messages on the screen. To solve this problem, I created Nametag.

### Awards

Featured as Student App of the Month in London App Brewery's monthly newsletter, The L.A.B. Report.

>This month, we've chosen Wyatt Harrell who has built this ingenious Nametag app after completing our online iOS app development boot camp. It uses Today Extensions to display your details on the lock screen so that if someone finds your phone they can contact you."
