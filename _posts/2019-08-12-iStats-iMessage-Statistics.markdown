iStats is a web-app that allows users to see statistics based on their sent iMessages. It was written in Python and makes use of the *chat.db* file generated by macOS and iOS devices. The front-end was created using Flask, HTML, and JavaScript. The design was inspired by the iMessage user interface and features clickable chat bubbles based on the features listed below.

### Features

- Top 10 most used words, characters, emojis
- Minimum, maximum, average character count
- Most texted contact number
- Activity by month, week, hour
- Search a string

### Motivation

For iStats, I was inspired by Apple's lack of a proper search functionality (prior to iOS 13) for messages in iMessage. As our semester long group project in *CIS 4930: Python Programming* at Florida State University, we built iStats to both create a search functionality, while also outputting other interesting user data such as: most used words, emojis, most texted contact number, and more.
