iStats was created as a program to output statistics on sent iMessages. iStats was written in Python and makes use of the chat.db file generated by Mac devices. The front-end was created using Flask, HTML, and JavaScript to ouput statistics in a readable format. 

### Motivation

iStats was motivated by Apple's lack of a proper search functionality (prior to iOS 13) for messages in iMessage. As our semester long group project in CIS 4930: Python Programming we created iStats to both create a search functionality, while also outputting other interesting user data such as: most used words, emojis, most texted contact number, and more.
